# Fake_News_Pridiction
This project aims to build a machine learning-based web application for detecting fake news articles using Naive Bayes classification. The model has been trained on a labeled dataset containing real and fake news, and the web app is built using Streamlit to provide an easy-to-use interface for users to check the authenticity of news articles.
